When you aren’t embedding pictures, videos, or utilizing a stylish color scheme on your next web development project, you still have; arguably, one of the most important elements of design- typography. The subtle variance in the styles of glyphs and characters we see day-to-day may go unnoticed by the untrained eye. That being said, that’s exactly why most of them work so well- harmonious interface design is satisfying to the end user, and one less thing that’s on our minds as we type away a new text or email, read the news, or check the weather.

So, how do we move in the right direction with typography? In this article, we’ll look at choosing the right typefaces, utilizing simplicity, and making details count- this should act as a baseline for you to master typography in web design (and beyond!).

## **The Right Typeface**

While we can point our fingers at Comic Sans, say that’s poor design, and call it a day- there’s more to typography than just what typefaces and fonts look “good” and which don’t.

Okay…that’s an alright start to looking at this, but we do have to consider more than just looking professional, as Comic Sans is still a relatively readable font. Selecting both professional and readable typefaces is important. Check out the two fonts below…

While the first font- “Marola”, looks looks much more “fun” and interesting, it pays to have something that’s readable and understandable by as many people as possible. “Akira Expanded” is a better choice, especially for something like a header.

## **Harmony in Simplicity**

Keeping things simple is an important aspect of typography in web design. Even though there seems to be a lot of different fonts, even a single typeface can be utilized in many different ways.

Let’s take “Roboto Flex” for example. This font has variable weight and width, which doesn’t sound like a lot. However, if we take a look at this video…

<video autoplay="" controls="" loop="" muted=""><source src="https://storage.googleapis.com/web-dev-assets/variable-fonts/roboto-dance.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

…we can see that just two variables can make a massive difference in the way a typeface is presented. Keeping the amount of font families to just one or two across a website will help your design stay consistent and pleasing to the eye.

## **“It’s the little things…”**

Font families deserve an entirely separate article on their own, but there’s another aspect of typography that’s important to achieving that perfect aesthetic with your text- detail! A picture is worth a thousand words, and a thousand words can paint a picture!

CSS includes various properties that allow for the fine-tuning of your selected font families. This goes beyond adjusting variables like weight and width. You can adjust letter spacing (kerning) and line height from CSS. This can make a huge difference on the general effect of your text and can even give standard fonts a fresh new look, with the right adjustments.

Block width is one final thing to consider in your journey to typographic perfection. Having the right number of characters in one line can have a great impact on readability just past CSS properties.

These are but a few basics that should be mastered throughout the course of your web development career. New resources, new typefaces, and ever-changing techniques are closer to the present than you think. Be sure to stay on top of things to sharpen your skills and refresh your memory every once in a while.
